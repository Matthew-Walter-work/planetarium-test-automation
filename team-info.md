## Team

1. Come up with team name

   - Galactic Gherkin Guardians (GGG Team)

2. Collect Github information so everyone on the team can be added to the team repo when it is made

   - https://github.com/jmsundin
   - https://github.com/katrine605
   - https://github.com/Matthew-Walter-work
   - https://github.com/RileyJatRevature

3. create git repository for group project

   - I recommend creating it locally first in a fresh Maven project

   - Just make the initial repo

4. create remote git repository and link local repo to remote repo

5. break before we set up Jira boards
